## Hello!

Dusk Audio is a solo endeavor to create high-quality audio plugins and make them available to everyone for free.

## The Mission

**Great tools shouldn't be locked behind paywalls.**

As a developer and musician, I've seen firsthand how expensive professional audio software can be. While there are excellent commercial options, not everyone can afford them — especially hobbyists, students, and musicians in the open-source community.

Dusk Audio exists to fill that gap: professional-grade plugins that are completely free to use, with no trials, no feature limitations, and no nag screens.

## Linux First

While all plugins are cross-platform, Dusk Audio is built with the **Linux audio community** as the primary audience.

Linux users have long been underserved by plugin developers. Many commercial plugins don't support Linux at all, and even some free plugins skip the platform. Every Dusk Audio plugin ships with Linux builds (VST3 and LV2) alongside Windows and macOS versions.

## AI Disclosure

These plugins are developed with the assistance of AI tools. If that bothers you, these aren't for you.

## The Philosophy

- **Quality over quantity** — Each plugin should do its job well
- **Simple, clean interfaces** — No unnecessary complexity
- **Efficient code** — Low CPU usage so you can run more instances
- **Open development** — Source code available on GitHub

## Open Source

All Dusk Audio plugins are open source. You can:

- View and learn from the code
- Report bugs and request features
- Contribute improvements
- Build from source for any platform

Visit the [GitHub repository]({{ site.github_repo }}) to explore the code.
